1. Write a program to make your own command like "ls" which will take two arguments and print subtraction of them.

Sample:

sub 3 4
result: -1

sub 3
sub command requires exactly two arguments.

sub @ #
sub command requires integer arguments. 


2. Write a program which takes multiple arguments from user, from which two arguments are mandetory thst is username and password. If program doesn't get valid arguments then print "Invalid arguments", and print the help which shows different options and it's usage (for reference, cp --help). There will be one switch for encryption and, one for help. 

Options:
-u --username -> for username
-p --password -> for password
-h --help -> for help
-e --encrypt -> for encryption

Samples:

./server -u perfectvips --password 123

output:
App name: ./server
username: perfectvips
password: 123
encryption: No

./server -e -u perfectvips --password 123

output:
App name: ./server
username: perfectvips
password: 123
encryption: Yes

./server -u perfectvips 

output:
Invalid arguments
<Should be dump help menu here like ls --help>

./server -h
<Should be dump help menu here like ls --help>

3. Write a function using variable arguments which can take any number of integer values and provide average of them.
