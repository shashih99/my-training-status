/*
Write a program to accept two numbers and find its GCD (greatest common divisor) using
Euclidean algorithm. The following example explains the algorithm. GCD of 123 and 36 is 3
123 % 36 = 15
36 % 15 = 6
15 % 6 = 3
6 % 3 = 0
GCD = 3
Input:
no1: 123
no2:36
Output:
123 % 36 = 15
36 % 15 = 6
15 % 6 = 3
GCD of 123 and 36 is 3
